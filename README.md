# Reddit Clone
As I continue my full stack journey I decided to build something just for fun that would give me the chance to showcase my front end skills. I chose to rebuild the Reddit site because it has many desirable web app features like posts, comments, upvotes, threading and sharing to social media. Also, reddit is cool!
